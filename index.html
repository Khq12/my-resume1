    <h2>In brief</h2>
    <p>I am a starter programmer. Currently, I am a freshman
        student at Inha University in Tahskent (IUT) in Computer
        Science Department. I am interested in physics and
        science in general. I am hardworking and goal-oriented,
        however sometimes I find it difficult to work in team with 
        people. But I am trying to fix it by engaging in different team 
        projects with my coursemates at university and so on.
